Brief: Build a complete e-commerce website - develop the frontend client in a technology of our choice, setting up a database in MongoDb, and creating a RESTful API to connect the two.

Timeframe: Three weeks.

Description: I created a digital art webshop app in React. I decided to include common functions for e-commerce apps, like: search/filtering functions, add to cart and a checkout function.
I also added an login/admin page to handle the orders and mark them as shipped.

This was my first React project.
